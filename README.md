<h3 align="center">Calculator</h3>

<p align="center">This is my calculator project that i made over the course of 1 week
for TheOdinProject foundations course.
I took inspiration from the IOS Iphone calculator as that's what i
had sitting on my lap.
I tried to replicate as much functionality and prevent as much unwanted behavior from it as i could muster.

During this project i had to expand my javascript knowledge significantly
as well as test my CSS skills.

I'm pleased with the overall result.</p>
